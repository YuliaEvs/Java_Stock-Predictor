## Stock Predictor
a Java-based application that uses mathematical models and statistical algorithms to forecast stock price trends. 
It collects and processes historical stock data, then applies predictive models—such as moving averages, linear regression, or machine learning techniques—to analyze market patterns and estimate future price directions. 
The Stock Predictor can generate insights that help users make informed investment decisions by projecting trends based on both short - and long-term data.
